# Abstract
This project provides an analysis of massive open online certificate (MOOC) learning data through Newcastle University while showing the benefits of reproducible data science using r markdown. The data set contains 52 .csv files, of which three files have been used for performing analysis. The analysis performed is a freehand analysis of the data set with the liberty to generate our own questions and find their answers.
