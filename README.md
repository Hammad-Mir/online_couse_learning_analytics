# Abstract
This project provides an analysis of massive open online certificate (MOOC) learning data through Newcastle University while showing the benefits of reproducible data science using r markdown. The data set contains 52 .csv files, of which three files have been used for performing analysis. The analysis performed is a freehand analysis of the data set with the liberty to generate our own questions and find their answers.

This project focuses of the analysis of the learner data for Cyber Security massive open online certificate (MOOC) by Newcastle
University. It also demonstrates the advantages of repeatable data research with r markdown. The data
collection comprises 62.csv files, from which enrollment data has been utilized for analysis with target
demographic understanding as the overall objective.

The main objective of this analysis is to understand the target demographic. Our aim is to develop insights of
the learners enrolled in the course. This analysis will helpful in developing the course to have a wider reach
and be more appealing to the learners. We analyse the user information such as location data, gender, age,
education, etc. to generate these insights. This gives us a better understanding of “Who” the learners are so
that the course can be developed to the business needs and market demand.
We followed the Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology for our analysis, which is an
open standard process model that describes common approaches for data mining and analysis and is the most widely-used analytics model.

The dataset for Cyber Security: Safety at Home, Online, in Life course includes 62 with files containing user
data such as follows: - Archetype survey - Enrolments - Leaving survey response - Question response - Step
activity - Team members - Video stats - Weekly sentiment survey responses
The dataset comprises data gathered from seven runs of the course. During our analysis, we concentrated
solely on the enrolment data, which contains information about each learner such as gender, age, education, nation, and so on.

Following the CRISP-DM model, we performed our analysis in more than one cycle as explained below, with
our main business objective being target demographic understanding:

- Cycle 1: Where learners are from
- Cycle 2: Enrolments over 7 runs
- Cycle 3: Who the learners are
